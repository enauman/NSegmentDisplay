# NSegmentDisplay
Arduino library for programming non-standard multiplexed LED displays, such as those from appliances.<br />
Standard 7-segment displays can be wired with drivers and programmed with many libraries that provide ease of use. But non-standard LED displays don't have such convenience because of their variability. With this library I am trying to provide some shortcuts to programming any LED appliance display provided it is multiplexed, that is, its circuit has shared common pins to address specific digits with individual pins for segments across digits. 
## Where to get them
Non-standard LED displays can be found in common discarded appliances such as microwaves and DVD/VCR players.
